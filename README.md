**In case you're here about qgis2threejs**
Ignore all files except the folder called `webmap/`. If you look inside, you'll see all the files that qgis2threejs outputs, and this is all you need to upload for your webmap to be publicly visible. In my case, that's at `axelmalahieude.github.io/webmap`


Useful commands:

`bundle install` update with changes from gemfile
`bundle exec jekyll serve` run locally

More:
* Change theme by changing line 14 `gem "minima"` to some other theme in gemfile
* Also requires changing `_config.yml` theme line
* Then run `bundle install`
