<h1 id="top">AVIATA: Autonomous Vehicle Infinite Air-Time Apparatus</h1>

This year-long project was completed during my time at UCLA as a part of the UAS@UCLA club organization, which focuses on unmanned aerial systems. More details coming soon, as we are currently still working on completing the research project and presenting the results to NASA, who sponsored this project.
