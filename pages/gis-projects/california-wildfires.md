<h1>3D Mapping California Wildfires in August 2020</h1>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">
In August 2020, there were several large fires burning throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. As part of a 3D web mapping project, I decided to use the latest available data to create a 3D visualization of the situation. This web map presents the extent of the wildfires in the southeastern Bay Area as of August 27th, 2020. Air quality, major cities, affected buildings, and major roads are also shown. All of this data is mapped atop a digital elevation model to show relief.

**Summary**
* Web map of fires in the San Fransisco Bay Area in August 2020
* Uses the qgis2threejs plugin to generate the web map
* Includes 3-dimensional features and labels for context
